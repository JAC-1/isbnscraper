In 1931 they were taken away from their families and sent to a camp to be trained as good 'white' Australians. They were told to forget their mothers, their language, their home. But Molly would not forget. She and her cousins escaped and walked back to Jigalong, 1600 kilometres away, following the rabbit-proof fence north as part of their guide across the desert. This is the true stoy of that walk, told by Molly's daughter, Doris. It is also a prize-winning film.",

      "about": "San Francisco lies under a cloud of radioactive dust. People live in half-deserted apartment buildings, and keep electric animals as pets because so many real animals have died. Most people emigrate to Mars - unless they have a job to do on Earth. Like Rick Deckard - android killer for the police and owner of an electric sheep. This week he has to find, identify, and kill six androids which have escaped from Mars. They're machines, but they look and sound and think like humans - clever, dangerous humans. They will be hard to kill. The film  Blade Runner was based on this famous novel.",

It uses electrical energy directly, never sleeps, and can work in any temperature. It is stronger, more efficient - and sometimes more human than human beings. Isaac Asimov was one of the greatest science-fiction writers, and these short stories give us an unforgettable and terrifying vision of the future.",

At seven levels, from Starter to Advanced, this impressive selection of carefully graded readers offers exciting reading for every student's capabilities.  In the early 1990s Katy, a young reporter, arrives in Sarajevo, a city under siege, and receives conflicting advice from two colleagues.

'This is not my war or your war,' an Italian journalist explains. 'We just report what we see, but we stay outside it. We can't get too involved. We mustn't get too near.'

      "about": "BFCシリーズ4作目。 前作でパイ職人として大切なことを見つけたエドは、ゴースト・アベニューの仲間たちと共に、古いトレーラーを改装して小さなパイの店をはじめました。 小さな店ですが、エドの作るパイは評判を呼び、続々とお客さんが足を運ぶように。 一方、エドを妨害していたジェレミーは、これまで描かれていなかった一面が明らかになり、ただの鼻持ちならないヤツではないことがわかってきましたが…。 だんだん物語の奥行きが増してきて、今後の展開が気になります。  本書の後半では、登場人物たちのセリフに焦点を当てた解説が収録されています。 英語を読んでいると必ず出会う、くだけた表現や誇張した言い方、省略されたやり取りなどを読むときのポイントが紹介されていました。 学生時代に読もうとした英語の本のセリフに「？？？」となって、つまづいてしまった経験があったので、セリフの読みづらさの正体や読むコツがわかったのはありがたかったです。  今回も本文→解説→付録のリーフレット(本文をBFCのメソッドで3色に色分けしたもの)の順番で読了。 解説のあとにもう一度本文を読む形になったので、解説の内容を実際に体感しながら読めていい復習になりました。",

      "about": "BFCシリーズ3作目。 新しい店を開くチャンスも奪われ、ビッグ・ファット・キャットともはぐれてしまったエドは、朦朧とした意識のまま町を彷徨い、行き倒れてしまいます。 目を覚ましたエドがいたのは、人々がゴースト・アベニューと呼ぶ、ゴミにまみれた廃墟街でした。 エドはホームレスの老人・ウィリーに案内されて、かつては美しい映画館だった建物へ。 そこでは何人ものホームレスたちが暮らしていました。 彼らとたき火を囲んだエドは、ぽつりぽつりと自分のことを話し始めます…  前2作よりも、より本格的な物語になっています。 情景描写や心理描写、それにくだけた日常会話の表現などがたくさん出てきました。 今回著者が強調しているのは、読み飛ばすスキルを身につけること。 本書後半の解説部分もこの点に重点を置いて書かれています。 物語を進める動力源になる文章を押さえておけば、細部の描写がわからなくても物語を楽しめるよ！…とおおらかな気持ちで英文に向かい合うことを肯定してくれました。  今回は本文→解説→付録のリーフレット(本文をBFCのメソッドで3色に色分けしたもの)の順番で読んだので、結果的に本文を2回通り読むことになりました。 1回目もあまり苦労なく読めましたが、やはり解説のあとに読んだ2回目は1回目よりも物語の情景がイメージしやすかったです。 それに動力源の文章を意識しながら読んだせいか、1回目よりも気楽に読めた印象。 少しずつステップアップしていく本シリーズに楽しみながらついていきたいです。",

      "about": "談話室で教えてもらってからずっと気になっていた本。 実は英語はあまり好きではなくて（と同時に日本語も不自由）、英語を読むのかぁと抵抗感も同時にあったのが正直なところ。  ふと、読書猿さんが著者向山貴彦氏が訃報をリツイートしていてやっぱり読まなきゃと思い至り読んでみた。  著者向山淳子さんは、苦労して英語を身につけたそう。たとい留学してもまったく身につかずに帰ってきてしまう人もいるのだという。でも、彼女は身につけた。方法はただただ苦しみながらでも英語を読むということそれだけだった。  日本で英語は分野がいくつかに分かれています。スピーキング、ライティング、リーディング…しかしそんなことをしているのは日本だけだという。 最近はヨンギノウとかいう謎の試験を課す風潮。大学入試制度も「汚さ」れていく。 英語の教育はますますめちゃくちゃになるかもしれません。 著者は、聴いたり書いたりするには、英語の表現が頭になければならないといいます。そのためにどんどん読むことで頭にストックを作っていくのです。文法重視、訳読中心から多読へとスムーズにシフトしていけば英語を身につけるのは難しいことではないのだと思いました。  本書では、ブルーベリーパイが大好物のでぶ猫とパイ作りが得意なお菓子職人のストーリーを軸に英語の読み方を解説します。今までごちゃごちゃしていた文法を読むのに必要なものにしぼってあとは多読していこうという明確な姿勢。  練習用の絵本も、アメリカ風ながらほろりとさせてくれます。でぶ猫が愛らしくてたまりません。  巻末には、副読本の読書案内が付く。僕のタイムラインではお馴染みのロアルドダールが初級に、ハリーポッターは上級に位置するそうだ。 英語嫌いは、英語を読まないからならば、これからやさしい英語の本から原書を読んでいこう、そうしよう、と強く思わせてくれる読書体験でした。",

      "about": "ざっくりとあらすじを言えば、居留地で悶々と生活する中学生の主人公Arnoldが、勇気を出して白人だけの高校へ転校・進学し、カルチャーショックや地元での摩擦、あるいは近親者の死を経て成長してゆく、というお話です。  前半はややお下劣な言葉が満載も、エンディングがなかなか感動的な自己陶冶系小説でした。ただ、類似の作品Wonderの二番煎じに思えたのも事実。  Wonderでは先天性の口蓋裂症の男の子が家庭学習から一転、中学入学間際に一般通学へと変更、学校生活での摩擦を乗り越えてゆく話でした。一方本作は、居留地という狭い世界で、しかも飲んだくれやアル中や暴力に囲まれた環境で育ったインディアン少年が、白人のみの学校へ転校したことで新たな世界観、価値観を得、成長していくというものです。どちらも筋が似通っています。  もちろん違いもあります。Wonderがミドルクラスの割と裕福な白人家族の話である一方、本作では、居留地の、解決しようのない貧困という現実がハッキリと描かれます。私は居留地 Reservationというと、もっと手厚く保護され、補助金はじめ大学進学などについても白人より優遇されているイメージがありました。真実はわかりませんが、少なくとも物語中ではむしろ貧しく、そしてその苦しさから安酒に溺れるアル中だらけの悲惨な環境として描写されています。こうした環境からか、物語では祖母が飲酒運転の車にひかれて死亡、姉は自宅兼キャンピングカーでパーティーをしたところゲストがガスに火をかけたまま忘れて帰り、焼死。父親のベストフレンドEugineは酔っぱらった友達により酔った勢いで射殺される。さらに撃った友人は刑務所で自殺。とにかく命が続かない。  読後の後味をさらに苦くさせるのが筆者のあとがき。私、てっきり本作は物語と思っていました。が、筆者は正真正銘のインディアンで、実話に基づくもフィクションとしてこれを書いている模様。作中で主人公Arnoldのベストフレンドであり転校後は反目しあうRowdyも、Randyという現実の友人をモデルにしたそう。しかもその現実のRandyは晴れた日の見通しの良い道路を飲酒運転し、対向車線に突っ込んで亡くなったそう。彼はシートベルトを着けず、酔っぱらいながらスマホをいじっていたと想定されているようです。ちょっとワルだったり欠点があったり、でも心根は優しかったりする友人たち。大切だからこそ彼らの自暴自棄や無謀を直してくれるよう頼むも、絶対に言う事を聞かない彼ら。そんな頑固さに対する筆者の苛立たしさや悲しさが漂うあとがきは非常に重たいものでした。  さて英語ですが、YA向けを強く意識しているのかあるいはこれが若者言葉の常なのかわかりませんが、きれいでない言葉のオンパレードで、非常に勉強になりました。tonto (n) 気違い, wuss (n) 臆病者, boner (n) いわゆるイチモツ, flip off (v) 中指を突き立てる, homophobic (j) ホモ嫌いの, fag (n) オカマ、などなど。これ以外にもまあ自慰行為の話なども出てくることもあり、まあ下ネタが原因で抗議が来るのならば分からなくはない笑  ・・・ 読み始めは、「これは小中学生向けのただのYA本だわ」と失敗した感が強かったのですが、最後の数章とあとがきでひっくり返されました。綺麗に言えばこれも多様性であり自由であり、またそれらの代償なのかもしれませんが、世界大国たるアメリカの暗部を覗いた気分になったことは否めませんでした。",

In the never-ending war between good and evil, The Chronicles of Narnia set the stage for battles of epic proportions. Some take place in vast fields, where the forces of light and darkness clash. But other battles occur within the small chambers of the heart and are equally decisive. Journeys to the ends of the world, fantastic creatures, betrayals, heroic deeds and friendships won and lost -- all come together in an unforgettable world of magic. So let the adventures begin. The first volume in The Chronicles of Narnia® The Magician's Nephew Narnia ... where Talking Beasts walk ... where a witch awaits ... where a new world is about to be born. On a daring quest to save a beloved life, two friends are hurled into another world, where an evil sorceress seeks to enslave them.
